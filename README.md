# Laptop Price Analysis Using Python

#### Overview

This project explores how various hardware and software features affect laptop prices using Python. It includes a comprehensive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to identify market trends, pricing drivers, and customer preferences across brands and configurations.

#### Objective

1.Analyze how specifications such as RAM, CPU, GPU, storage type, and display influence laptop prices.

2.Identify key factors driving laptop costs.

3.Compare pricing trends across brands and product types.

4.Provide data-driven insights for manufacturers, retailers, and consumers.

#### Data Preprocessing

##### Steps performed:

1.Loaded and explored dataset.

2.Checked data shape and column overview.

3.Removed duplicates and handled missing values.

4.Converted data types and standardized features.

5.Conducted descriptive statistics for understanding data distribution.


#### Tools & Libraries

1.Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)

2.Jupyter Notebook for analysis and visualization

3.PowerPoint for reporting insights


####  Analysis Performed (Problem Statement):

##### Comparative / Ranking Analysis

1.Top 10 Most Expensive & Affordable Laptops

2.Most Premium & Budget Models per Company

3.Top 5 Companies by Revenue

##### Distribution & Category-Wise Analysis

1.Price Trends by CPU Frequency, Weight, RAM, and Storage

2.Average Laptop Price by OS, GPU, Screen Type, and CPU Manufacturer

##### Correlation & Relationship Analysis

1.Correlation between RAM and Price (0.74)

2.Correlation between Screen Size and Weight (0.83)

3.Relationship between technical features and pricing


####  Key Insights

1.Performance drives price: High-end CPUs, GPUs, SSDs, and large RAM significantly increase cost.

2.SSDs dominate modern laptops for speed and reliability; HDDs remain in budget models.

3.4K/Retina displays and premium designs command higher prices.

4.Dell, Lenovo, and HP lead in both sales and revenue; Apple holds premium market share.

5.Students (98.5%) are the main buyers, preferring mid-range laptops (8–16 GB RAM, SSD, i5/i7 CPUs).

#### Conclusion

Laptop pricing is primarily influenced by:

RAM and CPU performance, GPU model (NVIDIA/Intel), Storage type (SSD > HDD), Display quality (4K, IPS, Retina),Brand reputation and design quality

#### Recommendations

1.Expand mid-range offerings (8–16 GB RAM, SSD, i5/i7 CPUs) for value-conscious buyers.

2.Promote SSD-only configurations and phase out HDD-only laptops.

3.Segment products by audience:

3.1 Students → Affordable notebooks

3.2 Professionals → Ultrabooks

3.3 Gamers/Creators → High-end GPU models

4.Enhance display and design innovation across all segments.

5.Adopt data-driven pricing and promotional bundling.

6.Focus on GPU-driven markets (gaming, design, AI).

7.Leverage brand trust with user reviews and marketing.

8.Invest in premium professional laptops with 32–64 GB RAM and 4K screens.
