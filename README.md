3. **4K/Retina displays** and premium build quality command higher prices.  
4. **Dell, Lenovo, and HP** lead in both sales and revenue; **Apple** dominates the premium market.  
5. **Students (98.5%)** are the main buyers, preferring mid-range laptops (8–16 GB RAM, SSD, i5/i7 CPUs).

---

##  Conclusion
Laptop pricing is primarily influenced by:  
- **RAM and CPU performance**  
- **GPU model (NVIDIA/Intel)**  
- **Storage type (SSD > HDD)**  
- **Display quality (4K, IPS, Retina)**  
- **Brand reputation and design quality**

---

##  Recommendations
1. Expand **mid-range offerings** (8–16 GB RAM, SSD, i5/i7 CPUs) for value-conscious buyers.  
2. Promote **SSD-only configurations** and phase out HDD-only laptops.  
3. Segment products by audience:  
   -  **Students** → Affordable notebooks  
   -  **Professionals** → Ultrabooks  
   -  **Gamers/Creators** → High-end GPU models  
4. Enhance **display and design innovation** across all segments.  
5. Adopt **data-driven pricing** and promotional bundling strategies.  
6. Focus on **GPU-driven markets** (gaming, design, AI).  
7. Leverage **brand trust** with user reviews and targeted marketing.  
8. Invest in **premium professional laptops** with 32–64 GB RAM and 4K displays.
